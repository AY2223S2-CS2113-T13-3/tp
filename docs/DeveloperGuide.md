### Product scope

BankWithUs is a powerful and user-friendly CLI-based banking system 
that provides users with an easy and quick way to manage their financial 
transactions and budget accordingly. With its wide range of features and 
easy-to-use command syntax, BankWithUs makes it simple for users to manage their finances on the go.


### Target user profile

The target audience for the command line-based Banking System is individuals who value 
efficiency and simplicity in their financial management. This group includes students, 
freelancers, and small business owners who are looking for a fast and straightforward way to manage their finances.


### Value proposition

Fast typers may benefit more from the CLI 
version of the banking system as it allows for 
quick navigation and interaction with the system using keyboard shortcuts. 
This can lead to a faster and more efficient workflow compared to using a graphical user interface (GUI), 
which may require more clicks and navigation. Additionally, fast typers may prefer the simplicity and 
minimalism of a CLI interface, as it provides only the essential information and features needed to manage their finances.
