<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `deposit AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be used as `deposit 300`.

* Parameters MUST be in the specified order for the command to take appropriate effect.<br>


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view-transactions-all`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
