## Overview

Helped create a CLI-based application that acts like a banking app. Users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, set save goal, set withdrawal limit, and view previous transactions with this application.

### Enhancements implemented

I have developed the add deposit feature, which allows users to add a new deposit to the current account. 
My teammates have also modified it to suit the evolved needs of the application. <br />

I have also developed all the features related to the `Transaction` and `TransactionList` classes, including adding, 
deleting, listing, parsing, saving, and loading the transactions.


### UG contributions

Documented the `Transaction` and `TransactionList` feature in the User Guide. 

### DG contributions

Added 'Acknowledgements' 'Setting Up, Getting Started', 'Non-Functional Requirements' and 'Instructions for Manual Testing' with reference to 
[AddressBoook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html). <br />
Further modified the DG template and fixed the typos and standardized the format (Uppercase/lowercase issues, no full stop at the end of a bullet point etc.)


### Team-based tasks

* Helped in creating issues for the team to work on
* Updated User/Developer Guides that are not specific to a feature e.g. Non-Functional Requirements and Instructions for Manual Testing)
* Released v2.0 of the application
* Reviewed and approved a significant number of PRs not authored by myself
* Refactored the code to different packages
* Created milestones and assigned issues to them
